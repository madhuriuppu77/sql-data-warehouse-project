***🧠 Data Warehouse and Analytics Project***

Welcome to the Data Warehouse and Analytics Project repository!
This project demonstrates how to design and implement a complete data warehousing and analytics pipeline — from raw data ingestion to insightful reporting.
It’s built to showcase industry-level best practices in data engineering, ETL design, and SQL-based analytics, making it a great addition to any data portfolio.

🚀 Project Overview

🎯 Objective
To develop a modern Data Warehouse using SQL Server, integrating data from multiple sources to enable business intelligence (BI) and data-driven decision-making.

🏗️ Phase 1: Data Engineering — Building the Data Warehouse

🧩 Specifications

Data Sources: Import data from two systems — ERP and CRM — provided as CSV files.
Data Quality: Cleanse and resolve data issues such as duplicates, missing values, and inconsistent formats.
Integration: Merge both data sources into a single, unified schema optimized for analytical queries.
Scope: Focused on the latest dataset (no historization required).

Documentation: Includes clear ER diagrams and data model documentation for transparency and collaboration.

📊 Phase 2: Data Analytics & Business Intelligence

🎯 Objective

Use SQL-based analytics to derive insights and create meaningful reports on key business areas.

🔍 Insights Covered

Customer Behavior – Identify top customers, purchasing patterns, and churn risk.
Product Performance – Analyze best-selling products, profitability, and trends.
Sales Trends – Evaluate performance over time, across regions and sales channels.
These insights empower stakeholders to make informed, data-backed decisions.

🧰 Tools & Technologies

Database: Microsoft SQL Server.
Data Integration: SQL scripts for ETL.
Analytics: SQL queries, views, and reports.
Visualization (optional): Power BI / Tableau.

📘 Documentation

All data models, SQL scripts, and documentation are included to guide both technical and non-technical users through the project.
